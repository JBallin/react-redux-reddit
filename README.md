# React Redux Reddit

### Description

Reddit clone that stores data in-memory using an [API](https://github.com/JBallin/g-api) provided by Galvanize (with some modifications). I was given the basic structure and seed data but otherwise built everything on my own.

### Usage

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Note: [API](https://github.com/JBallin/g-api) must be running as well.
